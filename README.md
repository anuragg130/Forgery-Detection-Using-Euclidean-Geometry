# Forgery-Detection-Using-Euclidean-Geometry

This project is aimed at detecting copy-move forgery in images using Euclidean geometry.

## Introduction
Copy-move forgery is a type of digital image forgery where a part of an image is copied and pasted onto another part of the same image. In this project, we will build a copy-move forgery detection system using Euclidean geometry. We will use the concept of distance transform and Euclidean distance to detect the forgeries in the image.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following libraries and tools installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
OpenCV
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash

pip install numpy opencv-python

## Running the Code
To run the code, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

bash

python forgery_detection.py
This will launch the copy-move forgery detection system, and you can use it to detect forgeries in the input image.

## Results
The result of this project is a copy-move forgery detection system that uses Euclidean geometry to detect forgeries in images. The system can detect the copied regions in an image and highlight them, making it easy to identify the forgeries.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to build a copy-move forgery detection system using Euclidean geometry. This project can be a good starting point for anyone interested in detecting digital image forgeries or exploring computer vision techniques using Euclidean geometry.
